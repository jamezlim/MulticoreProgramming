Obviously we can reach a better fitness with a smaller maze. Experimenting with maze sizes between 7 x 7 and 21 x 21, after a certain genome length (generally length of 80 for mazes of these size) the fitness just got worse. A genome length smaller than a certain number did not make a significant differenc. But to generalize genome lengths had to increase by some amount as the maze size increased. But again only to a certain length.
